CBC shows an acute effect characterized by marked leukocytosis (50,000 mL) and the differential count reveals a shift to left in granulocytes. Which of the following terms best describes these hematologic findings?",
    "exp": "Circulating levels of leukocytes and their precursors may occasionally reach very high levels (>50,000 WBC mL). These extreme elevations are sometimes called leukemoid reactions because they are similar to the white cell counts observed in leukemia, from which they must be distinguished. The leukocytosis occurs initially because of the accelerated release of granulocytes from the bone marrow (caused by cytokines, including TNF and IL-1) There is a rise in the number of both mature and immature neutrophils in the blood, referred to as a shift to the left. In contrast to bacterial infections, viral infections (including infectious mononucleosis) are characterized by lymphocytosis Parasitic infestations and certain allergic reactions cause eosinophilia, an increase in the number of circulating eosinophils. Leukopenia is defined as an absolute decrease in the circulating WBC count.",
